# Assignment 1 - Quiz Game

Due: Jan 21, 2021 11:59pm (hand in on discord)

## Description

Create a quiz game in the python terminal. The quiz game must have at least:
* 3 True/False questions
* 3 Multiple choice questions (3 or 4 options)
* 2 Written questions (like one or two word answers)

At the end of the quiz:
* If the player gets below 50%, show the message `x/8 You failed, try again!`. (replace the x with the actually number of questions the player got right)
* If the player gets above 50% but below 80%, show the message `x/8 You passed!`. (replace the x with the actually number of questions the player got right)
* If the player gets above 80%, show the message `x/8 You passed with flying colors!`. (replace the x with the actually number of questions the player got right)

Here is an example with just 3 questions:
```
